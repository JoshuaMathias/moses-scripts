# moses-scripts
Convenience scripts for uses of the Moses machine translation command line utility.

These Python scripts I created and used for my own research and experimentation with Moses, in order to carry out many tests. In the future I may add a script to do cross-validation.
The following scripts require command line arguments:
*moses_prepare.py
**USAGE: CORPUS_PATH LANGUAGE_IN LANGUAGE_OUT
